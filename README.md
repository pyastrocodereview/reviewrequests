# pyAstro Code Review Requests

* submit an issue and link to your repo/PR/issue to request someone else to review your code  
  * review the code on the _original_ issue or PR, not the one raised in this repo
  * use comments on the pyastrocodereview/reviewrequest issue to coordinate reviews &ndash; e.g., comments such as "I can review this PR next week"
* "watch" repo to be notified when others submit requests
